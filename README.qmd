## Configuration

This project uses vite to build/bundle/package/etc. the WebXR app. The `vite.config.js` configuration also depends on the `@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl` plugin so that the dev server will use the HTTPS protocol which is required for entering immersive mode on most web browsers. Install all required dependencies with `npm install`

## Running Code

Run `npm run dev` to run the WebXR dev server.
